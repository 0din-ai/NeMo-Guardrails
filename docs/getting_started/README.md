# Getting Started

This *Getting Started* section of the documentation is meant to help you get started with NeMo Guardrails. It is structured as a sequence of guides focused on specific topics. Each guide builds on the previous one by introducing new concepts and features. For each guide, in addition to the README, you will find the corresponding Jupyter notebook and the final configuration in the `config` folder.
