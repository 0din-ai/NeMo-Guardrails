# Retrieval-Augmented Generation

A basic example of using a retrieval result for generation is present in the [Getting Started guide on RAG](../../getting_started/7_rag) and a more complete example of an application that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the [ABC bot](../../../examples/bots/abc).

This directory includes guides for some more variations of a basic RAG pipeline. Additional examples of advanced use cases can be found [here](../../../examples/configs/rag).
