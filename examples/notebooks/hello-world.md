# Hello World

This is a hello world example.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

This guide will use the OpenAI `text-davinci-003` model so, we need to make sure we have the `openai` package installed and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set.


```bash
pip install openai
```


```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY    # Replace with your own key
```

We create a `config/config.yml` file with the following content:


```bash
mkdir config
```


```yml title="config/config.yml"
models:
 - type: main
   engine: openai
   model: text-davinci-003
```


```python
from nemoguardrails import RailsConfig

config = RailsConfig.from_path("./config")
```

Now, we call the main endpoint.


```python
from nemoguardrails import LLMRails

rails = LLMRails(config)

response = await rails.generate_async(messages=[{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello!"
}])
```


```python
print(response)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Hi! How can I help you?'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

Now, let's add a simple greeting flow. We'll create a `config/config.co` file.


```co title="config/config.co"
define user express greeting
  "Hello"
  "Hi"
  "Wassup?"

define bot express greeting
  "Hey there!"

define bot ask how are you
  "How are you doing?"
```

Also, let's add a simple greeting flow.


```python
define flow greeting
  user express greeting
  bot express greeting
  bot ask how are you
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Appending to config/config.co
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

Now, let's reload the config and use it again.


```python
config = RailsConfig.from_path("./config")
rails = LLMRails(config)

response = await rails.generate_async(messages=[{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello!"
}])
print(response["content"])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Hey there!
    How are you doing?
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```bash
nemoguardrails chat --config=config
```

```
Starting the chat.

> How much was that?
I don't know

> Why?
That's why.
```
