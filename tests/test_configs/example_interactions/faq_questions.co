# Demonstrates a simple faq handling while having a conversation in the main flow
# If the user ask an faq the main flow will be interrupted and the faq answered before returning to the main flow

# Open questions:
# - How can we resume to the main flow and repeat the previous question to give context?
# Solutions:
# - User injection flows (see flow_insertion.co)
