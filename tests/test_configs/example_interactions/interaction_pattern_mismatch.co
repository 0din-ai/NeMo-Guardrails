# Examples of flow interaction pattern matching and mismatching

# A flow can have 3 possible states:
# - Matching: head is not at the end
# - Finished: last statement executed, explicitly by keyword 'return'
# - Failed: explicitly by keyword 'abort', by child flow failure, from other flow with keyword 'stop'

# match
